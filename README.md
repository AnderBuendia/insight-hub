# InsightHub

> A web-based data exploration and analysis tool with AI-assisted insights

InsightHub empowers users to explore datasets, analyze metrics with custom filters, and leverage AI-assisted querying for deeper insights—all within a clean, predictable architecture.

## ✨ Key Features

- 📊 **Dataset Exploration** — Browse and manage multiple datasets
- 📈 **Metrics & Analytics** — Derive and track key performance indicators
- 🔍 **Advanced Filtering** — Scope analysis with flexible filter criteria
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Insights** — Ask questions in dataset context (optional, degraded mode supported)
- 🎯 **Analysis Snapshots** — Save and share analysis views

## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

- **Clear Domain Boundaries** — Domain-driven design with explicit entity relationships
- **Feature-Based Structure** — Organized by user-facing capabilities, not technical layers
- **Explicit System States** — Graceful handling of empty, error, and degraded states
- **Testability First** — 80% minimum coverage enforced in CI

**Testing Structure:** Tests are co-located with their source files (e.g., `Component.tsx` → `Component.test.tsx`) for easier maintenance and navigation.

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

- **Unit Tests:** Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Coverage Threshold:** 80% minimum (statements, branches, functions, lines)
- **CI Enforcement:** Tests run on every PR with automatic coverage reports
- **Pre-commit Hooks:** Lint and format checks via Husky + lint-staged
- **Pre-push Hooks:** Full test suite execution

### Coverage Reports

Pull requests automatically receive coverage reports with:
- 🟢 Overall metrics with pass/fail indicators
- 📊 Per-directory breakdown
- 📈 Trend tracking across commits

---

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

1. **Create feature branch** from `main`
2. **Develop with tests** — Write tests alongside features
3. **Run quality checks** — Hooks run automatically on commit/push
4. **Open Pull Request** — CI runs full quality gates
5. **Review coverage report** — Check automated PR comment
6. **Merge after approval** — Squash and merge to `main`
7. **Tag milestone releases** — use `vX.Y.Z-rc.N` tags for release candidates

---

## 🚢 Release & Branching Strategy

This project follows **Trunk-Based Development** (ADR-0002):

- `main` is the single integration trunk and is always expected to be green.
- Work is done in short-lived feature branches (e.g., `IHSQD-123-some-change`) targeting `main`.
- Releases are tracked via **immutable tags** (no long-lived `*-rc` development branches).

### Tagging
- Release candidates: `vX.Y.Z-rc.N` (e.g., `v0.1.0-rc.1`)
- Stable releases: `vX.Y.Z` (future — once production deploy exists)

CI runs on every PR and on pushes to `main`. Coverage thresholds are enforced in CI.
